Hello, and thanks for purchasing the Developr Admin Skin!

This package contains everything you need to use the template:
- the complete HTML/CSS/JS version, with 35 example files
- the RTL version
- a comprehensive documentation
- the landing page files (PSD and HTML)
- the original PSD design files

Important note:
Due to some browsers' security restrictions (mostly Chrome), you may need to put the template and the documentation files on your local webserver (for instance, MAMP or WAMPserver) or on any webserver, and access them through HTTP.
Otherwise, some features may not work correctly.

Any question or suggestion?
